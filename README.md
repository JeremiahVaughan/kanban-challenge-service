## Setup
I used JDK 16 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot but 11 or 14 should work (fingers crossed).

Run 'mvn install' in the root of this project (I am using maven 3.6.3)

Run 'java -jar ./target/kanban-challenge-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' from the root of the project;

Don't forget to run the client: https://github.com/JeremiahVaughan/kanban-challenge-ui.git

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at 904 808 5600 or jeremiah.t.vaughan@gmail.com
